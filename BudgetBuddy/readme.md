* Once downloaded, cd into the flask-expenses directory
* Within the directory, create a new Python 3 virtual environment (e.g. python3 -m venv)
* Activate that virtual environment (source env/bin/activate). 
** Note, you'll need to have sqlite installed on your machine to run it in development.
* pip install -r requirements.txt to install the necessary packages into your virtual environment
* Run python database.py to set up your sqlite or postgres database. The database will be filled with mock data
